# USYD-Cybersecurity-Bootcamp-2020-21
A collection of works from my USYD Cybersecurity Bootcamp 2020-21

Hello Reader,

Here will find a collection of the activities, scripts and diagrams prepared by me!

A shrot introdution.

Prior to attending the USYD Cybersecurity Bootcamp I was an international airline pilot but, as is/was the case for many people, COVID-19 put an end to my employment and possibly my career as a pilot.

I have always have a keen interest in IT and, in this day and age, cybersecurity. So I signed up for the course and looked towards a career change.

In this repository you will have access to some of the course work, activities that we completed, scripts written and network diagrams created during the course.

I look forward to the challenges ahead and the anticipation of a successful move into the world of Cybersecurity!

Stay safe.

Chris
